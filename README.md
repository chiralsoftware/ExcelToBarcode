# ExcelToBarcode
This simple Spring project converts an Excel spreadsheet into standard format labels, with text or barcode.
It uses Apache Poi to parse the Excel spreadsheet and uses iText to generate the PDF file suitable for
printing.  This is a compact and simple demonstration of the powerful capabilities
of these components, and how, with only a little bit of code, you can create a useful, real web application.
You can use this system live at:
